# Ear Reader
Ear Reader is an application that solves fragmented time.

## Introduction
- Support for later reading: Use a very short time to collect articles of interest.
- Support for voice playback: Voice playback can free your eyes and let us deal with other things while consuming online articles simultaneously.
- Support for multiple platforms: Because we have many platforms for accessing information, the software is best adapted to the mainstream information platform to ensure the user experience.
- More functions, as you can expect.
